# TODO
- Stop src/* files from being sourced from anything but nonstdlib.sh's use function
- Re-create all the trivial builders and shell script builders with functions that will source nonstdlib.sh
- tests
- I use corutils in some functions. Either make 100% bash or add as dep in nix package and note in README.md
- Lots of common bolilerplate. Maybe we need codegen?
